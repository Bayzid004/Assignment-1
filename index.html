                <p>There are no formal educational or license requirements to become a web developer. However, many
                    colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and
                    articles which teach web development, often freely available on the web - for example, on
                    JavaScript.</p>

                    <h3>Why Web Development??</h3>
                    <p>Web developers provide businesses with the unique, engaging websites they need to connect with
                        customers. While businesses could feasibly create their own sites using Wix, Squarespace, or
                        WordPress templates, these tend to look amateurish and run slowly compared to sites built by
                        professional Web Developers.</p>
